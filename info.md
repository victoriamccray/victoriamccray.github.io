## Frequently Asked Questions

### Are you open to work?

Yes! I would be most excited for the following roles, but I am also open to related opportunities:

Data Scientist or Research Scientist
- Conducting robust research projects, machine learning models, and analytical techniques for predictive power and decision making

Bioinformatics Scientist or Bioinformatics Engineer
- Computational applications for neuroimaging, biomedical, or healthcare data

Software Developer
- Programming of interfaces, data acquisition pipelines, or development of research tools (especially leveraging open-source technology and open data models)


### When do you finish your Master's program?

I expect to complete my program and graduate with my MSc Spring 2025.

### Is your Board Directorship with Black In Neuro full-time?

No. As a startup non-profit, Black In Neuro is primarily volunteer-run and most of the team volunteers their time where most comfortable, including the Board of Directors.

### What were the results of your thesis?

Cannabis was shown to increase functional connectivity for persons living with comorbid cannabis use disorder and schizophrenia, and performance on the reward task increased for patients after cannabis use. However, comorbid patients did not reach levels comparable to healthy controls (connectivity, reward task). These results are both exploratory and replicated from previous studies.
