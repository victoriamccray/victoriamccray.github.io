## Frequently Asked Questions

### When do you finish your Master's program?

I expect to complete my program and graduate with my MSc in 2026.

### Is your Board Directorship with Black In Neuro full-time?

No. As a startup non-profit, Black In Neuro is primarily volunteer-run and most of the team volunteers their time where most comfortable, including the Board of Directors.

### What were the results of your thesis?

Cannabis was shown to increase functional connectivity for persons living with comorbid cannabis use disorder and schizophrenia, and performance on the reward task increased for patients after cannabis use. However, comorbid patients did not reach levels comparable to healthy controls (connectivity, reward task). While the results of the functional connectivity analysis were consistent with previous research, this project was the first to explore the relationship with behavioral data.
