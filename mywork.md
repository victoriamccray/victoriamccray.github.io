I have 5+ years experience conducting research and data analysis. I have 3+ years experience as an Analyst in User and Market Research for medical device, product development, and marketing domains. I have experience conducting computational analyses for neuroimaging and biomedical data. I completed my thesis in the Learning and Brain Development Lab (LBDL) at Northeastern University by implementing functional connectivity analysis with clinical data. For my experience as a research assistant, I provided data collection and preprocessing in cognitive psychology and psychophysiology labs. In 2021, I joined the grassroots organization Black In Neuro where I developed community programming, communications and reporting, and I now serve on the Board of Directors for the non-profit as Director of Finance following the incorporation of the organization as a non-profit.
